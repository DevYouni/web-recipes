            <li><strong>Make the cheese layer</strong>: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>

            <li><strong>Prepare the lasagna</strong>: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven at 375F for about 30-40 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown (approx 5-10 minutes).</li>
